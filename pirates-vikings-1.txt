          Pirates
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

Representing the pirates, we have Alestorm, probably one of the better Scottish
Pirate Folk Metal bands out there. These guys are no stranger to fun, goofy
songs, but always with a pirate theme. They were probably always too hammered to
find the Lost Treasure of Mary Hyde.

ALESTORM - Drink
Considering the hobbies of Scots Folk, pirates, and folk metallers, it's no
surprise that Alestorm like to drink, and sing about drinking. This is a popular
music video for the story it tells. Count the number of times 'drink' is said
before and after fiddle/accordion interlude which shows the whole cast partying
together. Take the difference between these two values => a1. Hint: a1 is prime.

ALESTORM - Mexico
'We sail across the oceans, got drunk in many bars'
'But when we sail to Mexico that's where we party hard!'
Watch closely each time they show the video game. Find what the player score is
when each of the three following phrases shows up on the screen. Each answer is
a four or five digit number.
  'Level 1 Complete' => b1
  'Wash-o-meter' => b2
  'High score' => b3

The Sunk'n Norwegian (Acoustic Version)
One of the great things about folk/melodic/symphonic metal is how well the songs
translate to acoustic versions. I'm not sure where 'Wisconsin Way' is located,
but you'll find The Sunk'n Norwegian there. Count the number of times the line
'One more drink' is said before and after the accordion bridge (which also has
a small lyrics verse of its own). The difference between these two values => c1.

          Vikings
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

INSOMNIUM - While We Sleep
Spearheading the Vikings we have Finnish Melodic Death Metal group Insomnium,
with a single from "Shadows of the Dying Sun". I was lucky enough to see the
August 2017 eclipse from totality - the visuals at parts of this video portray
the appearance pretty well. "While We Sleep" is a good intro to using harsh
vocals as a percussive/rhythm instrument, which still carries the lyrics, but
leaves the melody to a lead guitar - this is the crux of melodeath. Their most
recent release, "Winter's Gate", is about a group of Vikings who set out to find
a fabled island near Ireland, despite dangerous winter drawing near. Start with
the number 0, then add 2 for each of the following lines that is sung with clean
vocals, or add 1 for each sung with harsh/unclean vocals. Hint: the final answer
should be between 6 and 12 => d1.
  'When you reap and sow only throe and resentment'
  'When all you feel is remorse, pain and regret'
  'Leave all the love we had behind'
  'When you realize that there's no point of return'
  'When you understand you can only move onwards'
  'We need to slow down so you can catch me'

TURISAS - Stand Up And Fight
Finland has the highest number of metal bands per capita; Barack Obama once even
pondered if there was a correlation between this statistic and good governance.
Finnish Symphonic Folk Metal powerhouse Turisas are named after an ancient god
of war from Finnish mythology, and they certainly dress like it - even at shows.
Their appearance and heavy melodic music have made them top Viking Metallers.
Listen for a few things, and write down the minute of the song when each of the
follow occurs (Hint: each answer will be an integer in the range 0 to 5).
During which minute does the symphonic interlude end? => e1
During which minute does the first chorus begin? => e2
During which minute does frontman Mathias begin a verse with harsh vocals? => e3

KORPIKLAANI - Vodka
The Vikings look pretty serious so far, compared to the drunken pirates. Perhaps
we can get the vikings tipsy as well? Once again we go to Finland, for one of
the most well-known Folk Metal tunes out there, Vodka by Korpiklaani. Their name
means 'Forest Clan', and their music has native shamanic folk roots. Count the
number of times the line 'Drinking is good for you' is said before and after the
accordion bridge. Take the difference between these two values => f1.

ELUVEITIE - Epona
Time for another acoustic piece. Swiss Celtic Folk Metal band Eluveitie are
known for their vibrant and varied instrumentation. They have songs in many
languages, including English, French, Italian, Romansh, and German, but most
importantly the extinct ancient language Gaulish - the language of this piece.
Their songs often cover Gaulish myths and legends. Read the video description to
learn more about Epona, the goddess of horses, wellfare, fertility, and health.
An easy question for this one - watch the band closely - how many women are in
the main lineup of the band as of the time when this video was made? => g1.

Wintersun - Loneliness (Winter)
Wintersun is a Technical Progressive Symphonic Death Metal band from... you
guessed it, Finland. This ballad is from an album with four epic pieces, each
corresponding to a season. Their music is as grand and ambitious as their genre
would make it seem. Frontman Jari has some of the most powerful growls in the
business as well as robust clean vocals. Pay close attention to his voice.
Start with the number 0, then add 1 each time any of the following lines are
sung with clean vocals, add 2 each time any are sung with harsh vocals. Note:
some lines may appear more than once. Keep tallying each time. Hint: your final
answer will be between 5 and 12 => h1.
  'I've become someone else and I can't go back, I tried'
  'With a growing sorrow in weary eyes'
  'Am I the one who is fading away'
  'Hear the howling call from the other side'
  'And one day when everything is gone'

That's it! If you enjoyed any of these bands, the remaining songs in the youtube
playlist are just suggestions for further listening.
