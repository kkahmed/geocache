          Pirates
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

Representing the pirates, we have Alestorm, probably one of the better Scottish
Pirate Folk Metal bands out there. These guys are no stranger to fun, goofy
songs, but always with a pirate theme. They were probably always too hammered to
find the Lost Treasure of Mary Hyde.

ALESTORM - Alestorm
When your band consists of a bunch of drunk Scotsmen, it's no surprise that any
music videos turn out to be lighthearted, swashbuckling adventures. This song
spawned a lot of '_____ reacts to Alestorm' videos on youtube. Buckle up!
Two questions for this one (Hint = they're both odd numbers):
How many alcoholic items are on the list of what a pirate needs? => a1
How many of Tyrion Lannister's buddies star in this video? => a2

Alestorm ft. Lady Gaga - Magnetic Telephone
Alestorm released "Magnetic North" to an unsuspecting world on August 1, 2014,
and no one figured out the significance. Until the music video was released on
July 29, 2015. Turns out, the song was composed to perfectly overlap "Telephone"
with zero editing required. This fan made piece splices the two music videos.
Under Cook'n'kill recipes, three items are listed in ounces. What is the total
amount of ounces required of those three items? => b1.
Under Drink'n'kill recipes, two types of rum are required. What is the total
amount of ounces required of those two items? => b2.

Over the Seas (Acoustic Version)
Time for an acoustic sea shanty! These alternate versions of folk metal pieces
to a good job of highlighting the variety of instruments used beyond just guitar
and drums. There is an interlude with a trio of instrumental solos. Count the
number of times 'over the seas' is said before and after this interlude. Take
the difference between these two values => c1.

          Vikings
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

Ensiferum - Lai Lai Hei
Starting off for the Vikings: Ensiferum, a Finnish Melodic Folk Metal band. With
lyrics in both Suomi and English, traditional folk instrumentation, a name that
means "sword bearing", and lyrics in both Finnish and English about fantastical
Nordic stories, Ensiferum are certainly at the core of Viking Metal. Many folk
metal pieces feature the traditional 'lai lai lai ...' chant. In this song, the
chant is sometimes resolved with a powerful 'LAI LAI HEI!' in unison. How many
times does this occur? => d1 Hint: it's an even number

EQUILIBRIUM - Wirtshaus Gaudi
Vikings can be German too. The Pirates were clearly obsessed with drinking, so
we'll turn to Bavarian Folk/Black Metal band Equilibrium to show us how to
indulge. Don't the folk instruments and tradition Germanic melodies make you
want to visit the Essen Haus? Frontman Robert Dahn demonstrates the use of harsh
vocals as a percussive/rhythm instrument, while other instruments take on the
melody. Two questions for this one:
What is the maximum number of beers Robert is shown carrying at one time? => e1
With how many women from the trinken halle does Robert end up with his arm(s)
around? => e2

Turisas - To Holmgard And Beyond Acoustic
Turisas is a Finnish Symphonic Folk Metal group - they sing of about Finnish
myths and stories of battle, and they always go into shows in heavy armor and
with painted faces. This is an acoustic version of the epic and driving song
"To Holmgard And Beyond" from the album "The Varangian Way", which tells the
story of Hakon and his Viking crew on their journey through Europe. Listen for
the line 'Holmgard and Beyond' and count the number of times the line is said
before and after the soft accordion bridge which is followed by a 'lai' chant.
Take the difference between these two values => f1.

KORPIKLAANI - A Man With A Plan
Time for another catchy drinking shanty. Once again we turn to a Finnish group,
Folk Metal band Korpiklaani. They started with pure folk music before adding the
heavy guitars, which is opposite from most groups of their genre. A few times
during this animated video, some clouds are shown moving their hands, smiling,
and chanting along with the 'hey hey hey!'. How many total clouds do this?
Hint: it is a multiple of four => g1.

Amon Amarth - First Kill
You can't have a collection of Viking Metal without Swedish legends Amon Amarth.
Their lyrics often focus on Norse mythology, and their most recognizable song is
probably "Twilight of the Thunder God". Frontman Johan Hegg will get anyone's
blood pumping with his ridiculously monstrous growls. Watch closely: how many
times is the personal pronoun 'I' yelled in unison and also backed up with the
pyrotechnics in the video? => h1. Hint: it's an even number

That's it! If you enjoyed any of these bands, the remaining songs in the youtube
playlist are just suggestions for further listening.

W = a1 + a2 + h1
X = b1 + b2 + g1
Y = c1 + f1
Z = d1 + e1 + e2
